# RFID Chip

The RFID chip is a data storage device that can be operated on by a [RFID Reader/Writer] to read and write its data.

The chip can be combined with any item to embed the chip into the other item. Once the chip is embedded, the other item
 can be used with the RFID Reader/Writer. If the chip is applied to a block item and the block item is then placed,
 the chip will fall off the block onto the ground.
