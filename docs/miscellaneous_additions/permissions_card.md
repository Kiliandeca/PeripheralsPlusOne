# Permissions Card

Card used by the [Player Interface](/peripherals/player_interface.md) to get permissions to modify a player's invetory.
 Right clicking a new card will bind it to the player. Once bound, the player can shift-right-click to open its GUI.
 
The GUI's options include:

- Get Stack: Allows the player interface to pull stacks from the player's inventory
- Withdraw Items: Allow the player interface to withdraw items from the player's inventory
- Deposit Items: Allow the player interface to deposit items from the player's inventory

The card fits in the player interface's inventory.
