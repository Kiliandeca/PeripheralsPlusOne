# Turtle Teleporter

The Turtle Teleporter is a peripheral which allows a turtle to teleport to various linked locations. To use one, you
 must take a vanilla redstone repeater and right click a teleporter with it to start a link. Then, right click it onto 
 another teleporter to finish the link. Teleporters normally only have one link, but it can be upgraded to an Advanced 
 Teleporter which can have up to 8 links.
